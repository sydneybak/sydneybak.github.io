                <p>
                    Volunteering at PALS (Pets-A-Lone-Sanctuary) in Lincoln County, Missouri was one of the most rewarding experiences. PALS is a no-kill animal shelter dedicated to finding forever homes for the animals and promoting animal welfare. My tasks consisted of cleaning dog kennels and cat litter boxes, walking dogs, feeding the cats, and helping out wherever I was needed. I have always had a love for animals, but was nervous to volunteer at the shelter. I did not realize how much I would enjoy being around the cats and dogs, and how rewarding it felt when they were adopted. One of my favorite dogs was a sweet-tempered old black lab named Eagle. I feared he wouldn’t be adopted due to his age, but by the end of the summer, a family fell in love with him and brought him home. Volunteering at PALS gave me valuable responsibility and communication skills, and now I always encourage people to adopt their pets instead of buying!

                <h5>Columbia, Missouri</h5>
                <p>
                    For the past two years, I have volunteered at the Columbia Walk to End Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease that causes an individual to lose memories and the ability to perform simple tasks. The Alzheimer’s Association is my sorority’s main philanthropy, and nearly all of the money we raise as an organization goes to Alzheimer’s research and support. Many of my close friends have family members who are affected by the disease. As a volunteer, I checked people into the walk and set up the colored flowers around the route. Each color represents a different connection to the disease At the walk, we are able to join the community in raising awareness for Alzheimer’s and the hundreds of local families it impacts. In the future, I would be interested in using my biochemistry knowledge to research potential cures for the disease.

                <h5>Foristell, Missouri</h5>
                <p>
                    Last summer, I had the opportunity to be a volunteer camp counselor for the Romriell Performance Horses riding barn in Foristell, MO. I volunteered at multiple week-long camps for kids at various skill levels. My work involved helping the kids safely groom and tack up the horses, as well as teaching them how to ride. It was neat seeing the kids gain confidence around the horses as the week went on. As someone who grew up around horses, it was really exciting to teach kids with little to no equestrian experience. I was able to practice my leadership and instruction skills in an environment where safety is essential.
