        <h3> About Me </h3> 
        <p> Hi! My name is Sydney Bakker and I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Missouri Columbia. I am from the small town of Troy, Missouri. I’m majoring in Biochemistry with minors in chemistry and biology. I’m also working on a certificate in Information Systems and Technology.
             After I graduate, I am not sure what path I want to take, but I will most likely be going to graduate school. I also want to travel and see more of the world.<br /> <br /> At Mizzou, I am a member of the Sigma Kappa sorority, where I serve on the executive board as the Vice President of Academic Excellence. 
             I am also involved in the biochemistry club. When I am not in the library studying, I spend my free time drawing, thrifting, and horseback riding. Another big passion of mine is photography. I really enjoy photographing nature, and I’ve even entered a few photo exhibitions! 
        </p>
