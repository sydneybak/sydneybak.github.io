            Throughout the past couple of years at Mizzou, I have had the opportunity to grow as a person and student. Going into my freshman year, I was extremely nervous to start taking college classes and live away from my family. With the help of professors and friends, I gained so much confidence as an individual. I never would have imagined running for a leadership position in my sorority, but being on the executive board alongside inspiring women has truly been an amazing experience. I am excited to continue building my knowledge of biochemistry, while also pursuing other interests like information technology. I took my first IT class as a course requirement, but I found myself enjoying the class. Now, I’m getting a certificate in information technology! <br/>      
            
            One of the traits that has guided me through the past couple of years is perseverance. Once I put my mind to something, I always try my absolute best despite any obstacles. As a kid, when I would fall off of my horse, my mom would always wipe my tears and encourage me to get back on. I often apply that to other areas of my life. If I fail, I always “get back on the horse” and try again. <br/>
            
            Although I am not sure exactly what I plan to do after I graduate, I will most likely be enrolling in a graduate program. I would love to travel and take classes in another state, or even in a different country. Using the skills from my B.S in biochemistry, minors, and certificates, I hope to get involved in medical research that will help the community. Whether that is a graduate degree in biochemistry or a doctorate in pharmaceutical science, I look forward to seeing where my academic journey takes me next.
